#programmingGames

Created this repository as [programmingproblems](https://github.com/rossdrew/programmingproblems) would get messy if I started adding loads of different languages, some compilable, some not.

Figured this out when I started playing with [Box-256](http://box-256.com/) and realised it can't really be compiled and without keeping memory including addresses, the solution was confusing.
