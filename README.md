# Programming Games

Created this repository as [programmingproblems](https://github.com/rossdrew/programmingproblems) would get messy if I started adding loads of different languages, some compilable, some not.

Figured this out when I started playing with [Box-256](http://box-256.com/) thanks to [Coding Horrors wonderful article](http://blog.codinghorror.com/heres-the-programming-game-you-never-asked-for/) and realised it can't really be compiled and without keeping memory including addresses, the solution was confusing.

### Future
_Some with commitable resources, some not.  These are more investigation avenues for myself_
